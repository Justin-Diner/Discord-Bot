# Discord Bot! Teach Your Channel JavaScript!
Welcome to my fully functional Discord bot. The bot has several commands to ineract with your community, but currently it is aimed at teaching core coding concepts. For example, the bot can explain methods and common algorithms.  Additionally, the bot will be able to solve Leetcode problems. Currently, only a few are operational. 

The bot also includes games that members of your channel can play.

The bot runs with modules enabled. It is made with JavaScript, Node, and NPM.
